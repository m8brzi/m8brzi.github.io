        <h1>MAC Address Switching</h1>
        <p>To be referred to as a "switch," a device must possess a MAC address table, enabling it to determine the appropriate Egress port for forwarding frames received on a different Ingress port.</p>
        <p>Upon the arrival of an Ethernet frame, the Destination MAC address is checked against the MAC address table to determine the correct forwarding destination.</p>

        <p>MAC Address Learning Process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>PC is connected to Switch on Gig0/0.</li>
            <li>A frame is received on Gig0/0.</li>
            <li>The Switch checks the Source MAC address against the MAC address table.</li>
            <li>If a match is found, the Switch already has knowledge of that MAC address. If no match is found, the Switch creates an entry in the MAC address table containing the MAC address of the PC, the Ingress port where the frame arrived, and the VLAN assigned to that port. This process is known as Dynamic MAC Learning.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>When are MAC addresses removed from the table?</h2>
        <li>The MAC Aging Timer, set at 300 seconds, functions as an inactivity timer. Whenever a host transmits Ethernet frames, this timer is reset. However, if the host remains inactive and doesn't send frames for 300 seconds, the inactivity timer expires, leading to the aging out of the corresponding MAC address entry.</li>
        <li>When a port is shut down or enters the errdisabled state, the MAC address table entry associated with that port is removed or deleted from the table.</li>
        
        <h2>Types of MAC address table Entries:</h2>
        <p>Static entry</p>
        <li>MAC addresses designated for functionalities like CDP, STP, LACP and others. For example: <code>0180.C200.0000</code> is the destination MAC address inside STP BPDU.</li>
        <li>MAC address to VLAN & interface mapping can be manually entered via the CLI using the command:</li>
        <code>#mac address-table static &lt;mac&gt; vlan &lt;id&gt; interface &lt;type/number&gt;</code>
        <p>Dynamic entry</p>
        <li>Learned via Dynamic MAC Learning.</li>

        <h2>MAC address table IOS Commands:</h2>
        <p><code>#show mac address-table &lt;dynamic&gt; &lt;address|value&gt;</code> -> Shows dynamic MAC addresses learned in the last 300 seconds.</p>
        <p><code>#show mac address-table count</code> -> Shows sum of dynamic and static MAC addresses in MAC address table.</p>
        <p><code>#show mac address-table aging-time &lt;secs&gt;</code> -> Changes Aging Timer from 300 seconds to some other value.</p>

        <h2>But how does switching based on Destination MAC address work?</h2>
        <li>For example; when a frame arrives on GigabitEthernet 0/0, the switch checks the destination MAC address against its MAC address table. The presence or absence of the MAC address in the table determines the subsequent action.</li>
        <li>If the destination MAC address is found in the table, the frame is either forwarded to the corresponding port or discarded. Conversely, if the destination MAC address is not found in the table, the frame is replicated and transmitted out of every port within the same VLAN, excluding the port through which it was received (the ingress port).</li>
        <p>Frames may be discarded for various reasons, including being too small (runts) or too large (giants). Additionally, frames originating from devices communicating behind a hub connected to the switch may also be discarded.</p>

        <h2>LAB</h2>
        <p>Tasks:</p>
        <li>Important device will be connected to SW on port Gig2/3 in VLAN 10.</li>
        <li>Device uses MAC address 28cf.daf2.ae41</li>
        <li>Ensure this MAC will never get overwritten and will survive reboot. Change Aging Timer to 3 minutes.</li>
